<p>Traders use Technical Analysis (TA) to have a good timing.</p>
<p>The main aim of TA is to identify if a stock (or any other aseet) is in an UPtrend or in a DOWNtrend, or "lateral".</p>
<p>In fact, a Technical Analyst (or a Chartist) is just like a Data Analyst, because both professionals use tools with the aim of finding trends and patterns in data with the intention of making forecasts.</p>
